**Components**
In React, components are the building blocks of the user interface. They allow you to split the UI into independent, reusable pieces that can be thought of as custom, self-contained HTML elements.

**Props**
Props are the way to pass data from one component to another in React.

**useState**


**Conditional Rendering**
You can render different components or elements based on certain conditions

**useEffect**
Before we understand useEffect, we should know side effects.

<b>Side Effects</b> are operations that interact with the outside world or have effects beyond the component's rendering. Example include:

- Fetching data from API
- Modifying the DOM manually
- Subscribing to events (like Websocket connections, timers, or browser events)
- Starting a clock
