Keystone is the identity service used by OpenStack for authentication and high-level authorization. It provides a central directory of users mapped to the OpenStack services they can access. 

**Key Functions of Keystone**
- **Authentication**: Keystone verifies the identity of users and services trying to access OpenStack resources. It supports multiple authentication methods, including username/password, token-based, and more.

- **Authorization**: After authentication, Keystone determines whether a user or service has the necessary permissions to perform requested actions. This is managed through roles and policies.

- **Service Catalog**: Keystone provides a catalog of all the services available in an OpenStack deployment, including their endpoints. This allows users and services to discover and interact with the various components of OpenStack.

- **Multi-Tenancy**: Keystone supports multi-tenancy, allowing multiple projects (tenants) to be managed separately within a single OpenStack environment. Each project can have its own set of users and resources.

- **Token Management**: Keystone issues tokens upon successful authentication. These tokens are used for subsequent requests to OpenStack services, simplifying repeated authentication.


**Keystone Architecture**
**Identity Backend**: The identity backend stores user credentials and other identity-related data. It can be configured to use various backends, such as SQL databases or LDAP.

**Assignment Backend**: This backend manages the association of users, roles, and projects. It determines what actions users are authorized to perform.

**Token Backend**: This backend handles the creation, storage, and revocation of tokens. Keystone can be configured to use different token formats, such as UUID or Fernet.

**Catalog Backend**: This backend stores the service catalog, detailing the available services and their endpoints.


**Keystone Components**
**keystone-api**: The API server that handles requests from clients.
**keystone-all**: A single process that runs both the API server and the administrative interface (for smaller deployments).


**Common Use Cases**
**User Management**: Creating, updating, and deleting users, along with managing their roles and permissions.

**Service Discovery**: Finding available services and their endpoints within the OpenStack cloud.

**Project Management**: Creating and managing projects (tenants), associating users with projects, and defining roles within projects.
