**Network Connectivity as a Service**

Neutron abstracts ports, networks and subnets and makes those programmable with the help of APIs. It also has a plugin architecture which makes it possible to integrate open source or proprietary vendor technologies to provide additional services which are similarly abstracted.

The service works by allowing users to create their own virtual isolated network and then attaches interfaces to them.

Connectivity between internal networks is achieved by creating virtual routers to create routes between those virtual networks. Even a virtual router could be connected to a public network, and a floating IP address could be allocated to your instance to provide external access.

The Nova Network gives you a limited set of topologies to create. One of the motivations for creating Neutron was to enable the ability to create rich topologies, including multi tier networks with a lot of features.

With neutron, we have the option to use Vxlan and GRE tunnels and not limited to using VLANs or flat networks only. Those tunneling mechanisms are important constructs for SDN in the data center and they enable us to use overlay networking on our physical legacy infrastructure.

Its pluggable architecture lets us provide advanced services like load balancing, VPN, firewall and lots of other L4 Layer four to L7 services with Neutron.

We should have a virtual subnet, which is an L3 construct.
Networks, ports and subnets are three core resources that exist in all neutron deployments, regardless of the extensions you enable from there.


**Key Features of Neutron**:
- **Network Abstraction**: Provides an abstraction layer for managing networks, subnets, and ports, allowing users to create and manage networks independently of the underlying physical infrastructure.
- **Flexible Networking Models**: Supports various networking models, including flat networks, VLANs, VXLANs, and GRE tunnels, to cater to different use cases and infrastructure setups.
- **Pluggable Architecture**: Offers a modular design that allows the integration of different networking technologies and vendors through plugins and drivers.
- **Security Groups**: Implements firewall rules at the instance level, controlling inbound and outbound traffic to and from instances.
- **Load Balancing**: Provides load balancing as a service (LBaaS), enabling efficient distribution of network traffic across multiple instances.
- **Dynamic IP Management**: Supports both static and dynamic IP address assignment through DHCP and floating IPs for external network access.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Ensures network isolation and policy enforcement across different tenants and projects.


**Components of Neutron**:

**Neutron Server**: The central controller that handles API requests and orchestrates network operations.
**Neutron Plugins**: Responsible for interacting with specific networking technologies. Examples include the Open vSwitch (OVS) plugin, Linux Bridge plugin, and others.
**Neutron Agents**: Run on network nodes and compute nodes, handling tasks like managing virtual switches, implementing security groups, and configuring network namespaces.
**Neutron Database**: Stores network state and configuration data.
**Neutron API**: Provides a RESTful API for creating, updating, and deleting network resources.
