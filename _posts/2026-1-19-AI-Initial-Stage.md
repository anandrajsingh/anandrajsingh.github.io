Natural Language Processing

**#1 The Dictionary approach**
The dictionary definition is not enough for real-world language. Word meaning changes with context.

**#2 Statistical Patterns**
Pattern matching does not means understanding.
The machine could predict the next word based on frequency, but it had no concept of what words actually meant.

<p style="font-size:24px;"><b>The Breakthrough</b></p>
Words as Numbers

**Word Embeddings**
Transforming a word to it's vector form is known as embedding.

**Visualising Words**
Similar meaning words are placed close together in a multi-dimensional space. Proximity indicates shared meaning.

**#4 Sequence Models(RNNs)**
<b>Recurrent Neural Network</b>
Process the sentence one word at a time,building up understanding as you go. The model maintains a "memory" of what it has read so far.
