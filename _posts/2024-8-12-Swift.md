Swift is object storage service in Openstack, designed to store and retrieve large amounts of unstructured data in a highly scalable and fault-tolerant manner. It is often compared to Amazon S3 and is used to store objects like file, backups, images, videos and other type of large data.

Swifts native interface is HTTP, which means speaking the language of the internet.

Swift is eventually consistent system. This means when you initiate a write, multiple copies are written out simultaneously. If the system is configured to write three copies and two of them complete more than half writes, the write is considered okay. The last failed piece will be taken care of asynchronously afterwards.

Swift is replicated storage system, which means we're storing multiple copies of your data for durability and availabilty. This gives nice and cheap recoveries, easy read and writes without having to have a lot of CPU. The default no. of replicas for Swift is three.

Note: Read about Data placement mechanism.

**Workflow**
- **Upload**: When an object is uploaded, the Swift proxy server recieves the request and determines where to store the object using the ring. The object is then stored across multiple storage nodes.
- **Replication**: The replicator service ensures that the object is copied to multiple storage nodes, providing redundancy and fault tolerance.
- **Access**: Objects can be accessed via RESTful APIs, allowing for operations like GET (download), PUT (upload), DELETE and HEAD (metadat retrieval).
- **Data Integrity**: Swift continuously checks the integrity of stored data, automatically repairing any issues it detects.


**Components of Swift**
- **Proxy Server**: Handles incoming API requests, such as uploading and downloading objects. It routes these requests to appropriate storage nodes.
- **Object Server**: Manages the storage of objects on the disk. It is responsible for retrieving, storing, and managing object data.
- **Container Server**: Tracks which objects are stored in which containers, similar to a directory structure in a file system.
- **Account Server**: Manages user accounts, tracking which containers belong to which accounts.
- **Ring**: A data structure used by Swift to map the location of data across the cluster. It ensures that data is evenly distributed and replicated.
- **Replicator**: Ensures that data is replicated across multiple storage nodes according to the replication policies defined.
- **Updater**: Handles updates to the account and container databases, ensuring they are synchronized across the cluster.
- **Auditor**: Periodically checks the integrity of stored data, ensuring that objects, containers and accounts are correct and uncorrupted.


**Use Cases**
- **Backup and Archiving**: Storing large amounts of backup data or archival information.
- **Content Delivery**: Serving static content like images, videos and documents.
- **Big Data Storage**: Managing unstructured data that requires scalability and redundancy.
- **Log Storage**: Centralized storage for logs generated by various services and applications.


**Swift vs Other Storage types in Openstack**
- **Swift(Object Storage)**: Stores data as objects in containers; ideal for unstructured data, with scalabilty and redundancy as key features.
- **Cinder (Block Storage)**: Provides persistent block storage instances, similar to a traditional hard drive or SSD.
- **Manila (File Storage)**: Offers shared file storage that can be mounted and used by multiple instances.


Swift is particularly well-suited for environments where large-scale, highly available storage is needed. It is commonly used in public cloud services and cloud services and private clouds where oranizations need to store large amount of data reliably.
