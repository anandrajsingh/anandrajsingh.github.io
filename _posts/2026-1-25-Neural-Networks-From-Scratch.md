How machines actually work

**From Rules to Pattern**
<b>Traditional Programming</b>

<b>Rules don't scale:</b> Humans cannot write rules for every possible scenario in complex tasks.
<b>Rigid Logic:</b> Systems fail when encountering data that doesn't fit predefined rules.

<b>Machine Learning</b>
<b>Pattern Discovery:</b> Finding consistent mathematical relationships withing large datasets
<b>The Goal:</b> Understanding the fundamental mechanics of how this discovery happens.
