 Nova is designed to automate and manage pools of compute resources and can work with widely available virtualization technologies as well as bare metal and high performance computing configurations.

Nova is the OpenStack project that provides a way to provision and manage compute instances. It is one of the core components of OpenStack and is often referred to as the "Compute" service. Nova is responsible for managing virtual machines (VMs) and other instances that run on a variety of hypervisors.

Nova provides instance lifecycle management with its rich API instance means a virtual machine. It is also quite distributed from the deployement perspective and runs on all hypervisor needs. Since VMs are created by the hypervisor of your choice, this makes Nova a hypervisor manager. Nova has an abstraction layer for compute drivers which allows us to choose which hypervisor or hypervisors in our environment. Nova either talks to hypervisor through API or has an agent that needs to be installed on top of the hypervisor to manage it with agent or API. It is not limited to the hypervisor environment but supports containers like LXC and also it supports bare metal environment as well.

For security reason the root login is generally disabled and if the root password is set, it is not distributed. Openstack uses SSH key pairs for authentication without password. The key pair is injected to the instance via cloud init process. Cloud init is a process to customize a generic cloud image at launch time.

**Architecture**
At top level nova-api service exposes restful interface to other components or users to talk with. All our communication within the project is via RPC message queue, which you see at the center. It is like a central hub for passing messages between daemons. This is usually implemented with rabbitmq. 

Nova Conductor is responsible for taking the instance build request requesting the scheduler to find on which node it is going to launch it on and also interacting with database and compute nodes. The reason we have conductor is security. There is no need to have the database credentials on every single compute node. Instead, the compute node talks to the database through conductor.

Nova scheduler takes a virtual machine instance request from queue and determines on which compute node it should run on.

Nova compute process is primarily a worker daemon that creates and terminates virtual machine instances via hypervisor APIs.

**Command**
- openstack server create --image `<image-name>` --flavor \ `<flavor-name>` --nic net-id=`<net-id>` instance-name

**Key Features of Nova**:
- **Instance Management**: Provisioning, scheduling, and managing instances.
- **Hypervisor Support**: Supports various hypervisors like KVM, QEMU, VMware, Xen, and Hyper-V.
- **Compute Resources**: Manages CPU, memory, and disk resources.
- **Networking**: Integrates with Neutron for networking services.
- **Storage**: Works with Cinder for block storage and Swift for object storage.
- **API**: Provides a RESTful API for managing compute resources.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Supports multiple projects and users, ensuring isolation and resource quotas.


**Components of Nova**:
- **nova-api**: Handles API requests and forwards them to other Nova components.
- **nova-api-metadata**: A server daemon that server the Nova Metadata API
- **nova-api-os-compute**: A server daemon that serves the Nova Openstack Compute API
- **nova-compute**: Interacts with the hypervisor to create and manage virtual machines.
- **nova-scheduler**: Determines which host machine will run a given instance based on defined criteria and resource availability.
- **nova-conductor**: Mediates interactions between nova-compute and the database, reducing direct database access from compute nodes.
- **nova-cert**: Manages X509 certificates (though it’s being deprecated in favor of more secure methods).
- **nova-consoleauth**: Authenticates users for console access to instances.
- **nova-novncproxy**: Provides VNC proxy access for managing instances via a web browser.
- **nova-spicehtml5proxy**: Provides SPICE proxy access for managing instances via a web browser.
- **nova-console**: Manages console logins.
- **nova-network**: Handles networking if Neutron is not used (also deprecated in favor of Neutron).

**Workflow:**
- **Request**: A user or service makes an API request to create an instance.
- **Scheduling**: The nova-scheduler selects an appropriate compute host based on available resources and defined policies.
- **Provisioning**: The nova-compute service on the selected host interacts with the hypervisor to launch the instance.
- **Networking**: Nova interacts with Neutron (or legacy nova-network) to configure networking for the instance.
- **Storage**: If required, Nova interacts with Cinder for block storage and Swift for object storage.

**Hypervisor Support**:
Nova supports various hypervisors, including but not limited to:

- **KVM/QEMU**: Commonly used in OpenStack environments.
- **VMware vSphere**: For integrating with VMware environments.
- **Xen**: An open-source hypervisor.
- **Hyper-V**: Microsoft’s hypervisor for running Windows and Linux instances.

Nova is designed to be highly scalable and supports large-scale deployments, making it suitable for both private and public clouds.
