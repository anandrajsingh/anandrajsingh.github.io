Glance is used to store virtual machine disk images when you want to spin up a new VM with Nova. Nova gets a copy of the image from glance and boots from it. Glance is where we store those pre-built images. 

Glance has a client server architecture that provides a rest API to the users through which requests to server can be performed. 

**Components of Glance**:
A glance domain controller is the middleware that implements main glance functionalities such as authorization, notification, policies and database connections. In a sense, it manages the internal server operations that is divided into layers.

- **Glance API**: The interface through which users and other OpenStack services interact with Glance. It handles HTTP requests for image operations like upload, download, and deletion.
- **Glance Registry**: Maintains a registry of image metadata. This component has been deprecated and merged into the Glance API in newer OpenStack releases.
- **Glance Store**: The backend storage system where the actual image files are kept. Glance can be configured to use various storage backends.
- **Glance Database**: Stores image metadata, including details like image ID, format, size, and other properties.
